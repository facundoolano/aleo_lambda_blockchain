# Aleo Consensus

MVP for an aleo blockchain. The current implementation uses a thin wrapper around some layers of [this SnarkVM fork](https://github.com/Entropy1729/snarkVM) and [Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html) for the blockchain and consensus.

## Project structure

* [aleo/](./aleo): example aleo instruction programs
* [src/cli.rs](./src/cli.rs): CLI program to interacto with the VM and the blockchain (e.g. create an acocut, deploy and execute programs)
* [src/snarkvm_abci/](./src/snarkvm_abci): Implements the [Application Blockchain Interface](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html#abci-overview) (ABCI) to connect the aleo specific logic (e.g. program proof verification) to the Tendermint Core infrastructure.

## Running a single-node blockchain

Requires Rust to be installed.

Run `snarkvm_abci`:

```shell
make abci
```

This will have our ABCI app running and ready to connect to a tendermint node:

```
2022-11-07T20:32:21.577768Z  INFO ThreadId(01) ABCI server running at 127.0.0.1:26658
```

In another terminal run the tendermint node:

```shell
make node
```

This will download and install tendermint if necessary. Alternatively, [these instructions](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/docs/introduction/install.md) can be used.
Be sure to checkout version `0.34.x` as current rust abci implementation does not support `0.35.0` (`0.35.0` has not been released yet).

At this point, both terminals should start to exchange messages and `Commited height` should start to grow.

## Sending deploys and executions to the blockchain

On another terminal, compile the command-line client:

    make cli

Create an aleo account:

    bin/aleo account new

This will generate an account address and the credentials necessary to generate execution proofs. Now run the client app to deploy an aleo program:

```shell
bin/aleo program deploy aleo/hello.aleo
```

That should take some time to create the deployment transaction and send it to tendermint. In the client terminal you should see something like:

```
2022-11-07T20:37:19.377Z INFO [client] Deploying program program hello.aleo;

function hello:
    input r0 as u32.public;
    input r1 as u32.private;
    add r0 r1 into r2;
    output r2 as u32.private;

 â€¢ Loaded universal setup (in 1793 ms)
 â€¢ Built 'hello' (in 6363 ms)
 â€¢ Certified 'hello': 147 ms
2022-11-07T20:37:32.973Z DEBUG [tendermint_rpc::client::transport::http::sealed] Outgoing request: {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "c45e1f52-a9f1-414e-ab2c-8b02746ee349",
  "method": "broadcast_tx_sync",
  "params": {
    "tx": "AAAAACQAAAAAAAAANTZhZ...
```
And a very long encoded transaction. Finally something like

```
2022-11-07T20:37:33.922Z DEBUG [tendermint_rpc::client::transport::http::sealed] Incoming response: {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",

  }
}
```

With a code 0 meaning the program was successfully deployed. You should also see the transaction being received in the ABCI terminal with some message like:

```
2022-11-07T20:36:49.862776Z  INFO ThreadId(65) Check Tx
2022-11-07T20:36:49.868743Z  INFO ThreadId(65) Verifying Execution: {"edition":0,"transitions":[{"id":"as1n0tlsr9rglamwr9tcqxf60ndpgkvhu83py79t78808w2vx95tv9q2ataeg","program":"hello.aleo","function":"hello","inputs":[{"type":"public","id":"1478829010713049050956129212113341334476706503997215127720201268298504260669field","value":"1u32"},{"type":"private","id":"375755831552960522697901416301536744612216033684938328198044587457082215962field","value":"ciphertext1qyq0lmjlsmwjwxxuxft5vw24pqj70fv76pj2q8a96m37mpyqregxzrge629d3"}],"outputs":[{"type":"private","id":"567543593766656021073803866365676200751324568935625558453747354077101654776field","value":"ciphertext1qyq265hx4fqu0edg8rdlwl44vatns7jwtn4hksfpylma3h3nm7rrxpcew67q6"}],"proof":"proof1qqqqzqqqqqqqqqqqm2uje400mwxc56umrwqj8jfefxnfnplgtcl7gc9kq68rxwnfzk...
```
and the rest of the transaction.


Finally to execute a program (locally) and send the execution transaction (with its proof) run in client terminal:

```shell
bin/aleo program execute aleo/hello.aleo hello 1u32 1u32
```

The command above will run the program and send the execution to the blockchain:

```
2022-11-07T20:44:07.702Z INFO [client] executing program hello.aleo function hello inputs [1u32, 1u32]
ðŸš€ Executing 'hello.aleo/hello'...

 â€¢ Executing 'hello.aleo/hello'...
 â€¢ Executed 'hello' (in 1151 ms)
2022-11-07T20:44:15.817Z INFO [client] outputs [2u32]

  "method": "broadcast_tx_sync",
  "params": {
    "tx": "AQAAACQAAAAAAAAAY2RkNTNlZjktM2I5Zi00N...
```
and finally
```
2022-11-07T20:44:15.830Z DEBUG [tendermint_rpc::client::transport::http::sealed] Incoming response: {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "3a45b4de-db1a-4d8a-a23c-dbe6180003f5",

  }
}
```
with the success response.

After each execution, tendermint node may be left in an invalid state. If that's the case run:

```shell
make reset
```

to restore the initial state.
